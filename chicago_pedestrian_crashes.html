            <p> Across the United States, traffic-related deaths have reached the highest levels in 20 years.<sup><a
                        href="#sources">(1)</a></sup>
                In 2021, pedestrian fatalities were up 13% compared to 2020.<sup><a href="#sources">(2)</a></sup>
                In 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel wrote in the Chicago Pedestrian Plan that "Chicago's remarkable pedestrian
                streets make our city a place where people want to live, work, and play".<sup><a href="#sources">(3)</a></sup>
                However, the trend in traffic crashes involving pedestrians points to a different reality. In 2022, Mayor Lori
                Lightfoot stated that Chicago is indeed a "car city"<sup><a href="#sources">(4)</a></sup>. Ten years after
                the Chicago Pedestrian Plan was published, little to no progress has been made to reach the city's 
                goal of making Chicago safe for pedestrians.

            <p> Chicago Crash data is collected from an electronic crash reporting system ("E-Crash") from the Chicago Police
                Department. Although some police district's E-Crash data became available in 2015,
                citywide data did not become available 
                until September 2017.<sup><a href="#sources">(7)</a></sup> This means that any data
                related to the number of crashes involving pedestrians is an underrepresentation of total crashes prior to September 2017.
                The total number of crashes after September 2017 is also likely an underrepresentation of 
                total crashes involving pedestrians because many traffic crashes - involving pedestrians or not
                - do not result in a police report being filed and thus are not included in the data collection process. <sup><a
                        href="#sources">(19)</a></sup> </p>
            <p> As government ordered shut-downs began in March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, traffic
                crashes involving pedestrians in Chicago dropped significantly.
                However, since early 2021, the number of pedestrians has returned to pre-pandemic levels,
                reaching 307 crashes involving pedestrians in October 2022.
                Chicago, like many other US cities, built infrastructure and roads that prioritizes private vehicles. Yet, car-culture is not new and does not explain the rise
                in the growing number of crashes involving pedestrians. In recent years, vehicles have become larger and heavier, and
                speeding has increased.<sup><a href="#sources">(10)(11)</a></sup>
                Higher speeds and heavier vehicles means a pedestrian is more likely to be killed or be severely injured after being hit by a vehicle.<sup><a
                        href="#sources">(10)</a></sup> Without any changes to how
                infrastructure is designed, pedestrians will continue to face unacceptable risks of getting hit by
                a vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>Crashes involving pedestrians result in life-changing injuries regardless of whether they are visible or
                invisible. The Federal Highway Administration has a measurement for evaluating severity of auto
                collision injuries and how to express injuries in crash reports, called a "KABCO Score".
                The five categories for injuries range from Reported/Non-evident to Fatal. "Reported, Non-evident" are
                injuries not included in the other four categories, or injuries that are not visible/evident.
                "Non-incapacitating" includes injuries that are not classified as fatal or incapacitating and are evident at
                the scene of the crash, including "lumps on the head, abrasions, bruises, minor lacerations."
                "Incapacitating" refers to any injuries "which prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or
                normally continuing the activities" that
                were possible before the crash occurred.<sup><a href="#sources">(9)</a></sup> Aside from physical and mental injuries,
                the crashe also imposes a large financial burden on the pedestrian. According to a paper published in 2007,
                the average total lifetime cost per pedestrian-motor vehicle injury case is $135,558.<sup><a href="#sources">(21)</a></sup>

                <p>Although fatalities represent a small percent of total crashes, one fatality is too many. In 2017,
                    Chicago implemented a plan called "Vision Zero",<sup><a href="#sources">(5)</a></sup> which was intended as an acknowledgement "that
                    traffic deaths are preventable and unacceptable" and a commitment to "using all available tools to influence the conditions and behaviors that lead to
                    serious crashes"<sup><a href="#sources">(6)</a></sup> with a goal of "eliminating death and serious injury from traffic crashes".<sup><a
                            href="#sources">(8)</a></sup> Chicago implemented a plan to reach zero deaths by
                    making streets safer through equitable investment, fostering a culture of safety through education, and
                    "designing streets at safe speeds to decrease crash risk and severity".<sup><a href="#sources">(13)</a></sup> </p>
                <p>If success is measured in terms of reducing pedestrian fatalities over time, Chicago's Vision Zero
                    is a failure. According to Chicago's Vision Zero Fatality and Crashes - People data, there were
                    16 fatalities in 2017, 31 in 2018, 49 in 2019, 46 in 2020, 61 in 2021, and 36 in 2022 (though October).<sup><a href="#sources">(12)</a></sup>

            <p>In Illinois, "drivers must come to a complete stop for pedestrians
                in any of those crosswalks: marked, unmarked, signalized or unsignalized."<sup><a href="#sources">(14)</a></sup>
                27% of pedestrian fatalities in Chicago occurred while the person was in the crosswalk. Laws do little
                to protect pedestrians when drivers are uninformed or ignore the law. Chicago should 
                invest in infrastructure and road design that prioritize people walking instead of waiting for drivers to follow the law.<sup><a href="#sources">(10)</a></sup>
                Solutions to making Chicago safe for pedestrians include banning right turns on red, 
                raised islands, medians at intersections, reducing speed limits, narrowing traffic lanes, and increasing
                pedestrian signals and sidewalk networks. <sup><a href="#sources">(15)(16)</a></sup>
                People should be able to cross the street safely in Chicago and anywhere they go.

            <p>From 2017 through October 2022, 16,160 pedestrians were hit by vehicles in Chicago.
                Nearly 50% of pedestrians were in the crosswalk when hit by a vehicle in Chicago across all injury types.
                Around 35% of pedestrians were in the road outside of the crosswalk when hit. People may be forced to walk in the
                street when the sidewalk is inaccessible, there are no curb cuts at an intersection, or have to cross the street without an accessible crosswalk.
                This suggests that there is a need to improve sidewalk networks and ensure that sidewalks, curb cuts, and signals are
                available city-wide. Pedestrians are disproportionately Black in the United States; Black, Indigenous, people of color, and
                lower-income people face a higher injury risk.<sup><a href="#sources">(17)(18)</a></sup> Inequities across
                racial and income groups need to be considered in the design and implementation of better infrastructure for
                pedestrians.

            <p> Chicago has indicated that it values making the city safe for people regardless of whether they are walking,
                biking, or driving. However, recent trends suggest that the city has not made progress towards its goals. Chicago is not the only city facing 
                a higher rate of pedestrians being hit by cars. However, these trends show there is a need for the city to focus on 
                building infrastructure that puts pedestrian's needs first.

            <p> I am interested in this question because I know many people who have been hit by cars in Chicago
                and other cities. Many drivers in Chicago do not stop at stop signs or follow traffic rules, so I wanted to
                learn more about the trends in how this was affecting pedestrians' ability to move about the city
                safely. The datasets I used came from the Chicago Open Data Portal.<sup><a href="#sources">(7)(12)</a></sup>
                The first dataset is called “Traffic Crashes – People” and each record corresponded to one individual
                involved in a crash. The records come from Chicago Police Department reports. The second dataset is
                called “Vision Zero Chicago” and each record represents one traffic death. The Vision Zero excludes some fatalities, classifying traffic deaths
                differently than the People dataset. I include traffic deaths from both datasets. There are two
                additional datasets on the Chicago Data Portal related to details on the vehicle and crash that could have added additional color to the
                analysis, I explain how some of these additional variables might have been useful below. I
                initially wanted to include data and charts on bicyclist crashes as well, but pivoted to focus on pedestrians
                because it seemed like there was enough to explore in each topic by itself instead of combining them.</p>
            <p>The charts I chose reflected my primary goal of telling a story about who, when, and how, pedestrians
                are involved in crashes in Chicago. I chose charts that allowed me to show the injuries pedestrians face
                and how the infrastructure in the city does not help keep pedestrians safe. I began with a line over time
                and a stacked area chart to illustrate a trend in the number of pedestrians in crashes over time. The
                area chart broke down the type of injury over time to better understand the details of each person
                involved. I next chose a beeswarm chart and grid charts to try and further illustrate that these crashes
                involve humans, not just abstract data points. By using charts that had one dot representing per person
                in a crash, I hoped to retain some humanism in the design. These charts were also helpful in getting the
                point across that although overall fatalities were low, there are still many people being killed each
                month. I used the grid charts to show more about how the current infrastructure fails to keep
                pedestrians safe. I utilized horizontal line charts in order to show large amounts of information about
                where a pedestrian was located or walking at the time of the crash. I chose dark blue for most of my charts
                because I wanted the reader to focus on the results and wanted to make the charts clear without too many colors.</p>
            <p>Further areas for exploration include more charts related to demographic details and who was involved
                in most crashes. There is limited data on the estimated cost of the crash, race of the person involved,
                gender, and where they are from. These would have helped give more details on the “who” is involved.
                The other outstanding question that I would have like to answered is which neighborhoods and
                intersections were the most problematic in terms of injuries and crashes involving pedestrians, but the
                datasets I was using did not have a field for which neighborhood each crash occurred, so I did not make
                a map illustrating these details.</p>
            <p>There are gaps in the data due to the subjectivity of police reports, underreporting of crashes, and
                the quality of data entry. Many records lack information about the pedestrian's action at the time of the
                crash: 26.3% of all records are labeled as "other" or "unknown." I would have liked to analyze the speed of car at
                time of crash; however, very few
                observations had any details on whether the vehicle that was involved was speeding. Other variables
                had few observations and thus limited what I could learn from the data. Since the data is
                collected at a time of high stress during a crash, or a pedestrian with incapacitating injuries
                may not be able to explain what happened, thus, the number of crashes in the dataset is an underrepresentation
                of the true number of crashes. Overall, I enjoyed trying to find good ways to reflect what was going on in the data
                and learning more about building charts in d3. </p>
